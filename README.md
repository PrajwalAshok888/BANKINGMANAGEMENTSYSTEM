# BANKINGMANAGEMENTSYSTEM

Project Description:

This project is a simple Banking Management System implemented using the tkinter library in Python.
The application allows users to create new accounts, log in to existing accounts, credit/debit amounts, display balances, and view transaction histories.
It stores account information and transaction history in text files and uses CSV files to maintain an index of accounts.
The user interface (UI) is created using tkinter, providing a simple and user-friendly experience.
The application handles errors for invalid inputs, non-existing accounts, and incorrect login credentials, displaying appropriate error messages.
The system generates unique account numbers for each new account created.
It uses a pin-based login system to ensure account security.
The transaction history displays the date, credit amount, debit amount, and remaining balance for each transaction.
The project includes basic functions to perform account-related operations such as credit, debit, balance display, and transaction history display.
